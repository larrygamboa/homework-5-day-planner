## Purpose

The purpose of the homework is to create a work day schedule application. The work day schedule app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JQuery, a Javascript library that simplifies Javascript programming. A date/time library called moment.js was also used for the app. The app will have the abilty to enter user input for time blocks during the day. The criteria are as follows:

1) When a user opens the work day schedule app, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
2) When a user scrolls down the page, they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
3) When a user views the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
4) When a user clicks into a time block, they can enter an event.
5) When a user clicks the save button for that time block, the input for that event is saved in local storage.
6) When the page is refreshed, the saved event remains.
